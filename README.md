# Dedispersed power analysis
This repository has the Python code I developed during summer 2024 to analyze the dedispersed power data from ARTE. This program show several plots, like how many times the signal surpasses different thresholds as a heatmap for sigma and DMs, alongside a histogram showing how much detections are seen per logfile analized over a specific sigma.
